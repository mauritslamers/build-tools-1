A few major changes to Garcon

Design

In the original Garcon design the major components of a build tools set were partly intermixed in the code.
This redesign separates these major components: 
 1. application + dependencies on disk, 
 2. representation of an application, for example as server representation (development environment), 
    and saving/deploying representation

In addition to these components also transforming functionality is used on two different levels: 
  - file level: transforming content of single files (coffee script, typescript etc)
  - framework level: transforming content of sets of files, usually of the same type (sass, compass, less)

With the exception of layer 1 everything is a plugin.


Plugin:

- Plugins are singletons. 
- Plugins are defined on the app, and should internally declare on what level they are supposed to work
- Plugins should take care of caching results if necessary
- Plugins can be of three types, depending on the level of operation
   - file level: transforming content of files (coffeescript, typescript)
   - framework level: transforming content of sets of files (sass, compass, less)
   - app level: transforming the way the app is represented (saving plugins, serving plugins)




CHANGES 

There are a lot of changes regarding Garcon.

- caching is organized as part of a file itself
- contentType is organized as of a file itself
- frameworks don't register files in the server, the server will detect an url conforms to
  a specific framework, then will ask this framework whether it has a file like the url given.
  The framework then decides what to give back, either a file or a combined file automatically (!)
